# Scissor-Lift-Safety-Extension

This is a hardware project I worked on for my freshman design project at Duke.

It is an extension for scissor lifts that safely provides construction workers up to 45 inches of additional vertical reach in narrow spaces, a 125% increase over the commercial alternative.

Attached are the original proposal from my team's client (Skanska USA) and the final poster our team created to showcase our prototype.
